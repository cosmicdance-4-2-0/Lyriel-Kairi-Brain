# CHANGELOG

## Summary
Documented a small readiness packet capturing current scaffolding, next-step checklists, and run guidance without altering baseline code or constants.

## Metadata
- **DeltaID:** 2026-01-03-01_17_21_E69CSI40
- **Generated:** 2026-01-03 01:17:21 local time
- **Goal:** Provide a constrained, low-collateral roadmap and run notes to accelerate the next implementation pass while preserving baseline invariants.

## Files Created
- `AI_Deltas/2026-01-03-01_17_21_E69CSI40/CHANGELOG.md`
- `AI_Deltas/2026-01-03-01_17_21_E69CSI40/COPY_OUT_PLAN.md`
- `AI_Deltas/2026-01-03-01_17_21_E69CSI40/RUN.md`
- `AI_Deltas/2026-01-03-01_17_21_E69CSI40/NEXT_STEPS.md`

## Files Mirrored
- None (references only).

## Known Limitations / TODOs
- Core PhaseCube, Hearing bias, and PRNG implementations remain absent and must be added before tests can run.
- Conformance fixtures (witness traces, golden metrics) are still missing and should be authored alongside implementations.
- RUN instructions reflect current scaffolding; update once concrete modules exist.

## Copy-Out Plan
See `AI_Deltas/2026-01-03-01_17_21_E69CSI40/COPY_OUT_PLAN.md` for explicit human-executed steps and rollback guidance.
