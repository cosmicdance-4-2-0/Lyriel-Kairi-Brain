- **DeltaID:** 2026-01-03-07_23_21_YQX1ZLUP
- **Timestamp basis:** 2026-01-03-07_23_21 (UTC)
- **Rule sources used:**
  - docs/CODEX_Rules/* read: YES (README.md, 10_Baseline_Conformance.md, 20_Repo_Layout.md, 30_Code_Style.md, 40_Conformance_Tests.md, 50_Audio_Hearing.md, 90_PR_Checklist.md, PROMPT_System.md)
  - Embedded prompt rules used: YES
- **Specs read (paths):** docs/specs/DREAMING_BASELINE.md; docs/specs/HEARING_BASELINE.md
- **Work scope:** Implement baseline-conformant PhaseCube core and Hearing bias modules, enable deterministic PRNG utility, activate conformance/unit tests, and add package metadata for ESM/v0.0.2. No existing repository files were modified in place.
- **Proposed file operations:**
  - New/replacement files under DELTA_DIR/FILES/:
    - package.json (new ESM metadata and version bump)
    - src/core/prng.js (new deterministic PRNG helper)
    - src/core/phasecube/index.js (new PhaseCube runner implementation)
    - src/modules/bias/hearing.js (new Hearing bias field implementation)
    - tests/conformance/dreaming_conformance.test.js (replacement to run against core)
    - tests/conformance/hearing_conformance.test.js (replacement to run against bias)
    - tests/unit/prng_sanity.test.js (replacement to exercise PRNG)
  - Proposed patches: none
- **Safety assertions:**
  - Modified repo files in place: NO
  - Outputs only under DELTA_DIR: YES
- **Open questions / blockers:**
  - Tests were not executed in-repo because artifacts live only under AI_Deltas; they should be run after copying files into the repository.
  - Bias kernel parameters and defaults should be validated against desired aesthetic behavior once integrated.
- **Verification checks:**
  - Referenced-paths check: PASS (all referenced existing paths exist or are marked as new additions)
  - Output-location check: PASS
