# CHANGELOG — 2026-01-03-00_50_22_CE7KVWFB

- **Date/time generated:** 2026-01-03 00:50:22 (local)
- **Goal:** Package a minimal, drop-in delta that improves next-step readiness without touching baseline sources by providing copy-out guidance and run notes scoped to this repository’s empty scaffolding.

## Files mirrored
- None (all references are to existing docs; no mirrors required for this delta).

## Known limitations / TODOs
- Repository implementation directories (`src/`, `tests/`, `web/`, `tools/`) remain empty; this delta only outlines next actions.
- No runnable artifacts are produced; integration requires copying guidance into the main tree.
- Conformance tests are not added; they should accompany future core additions.

## Copy-Out Plan
See `AI_Deltas/2026-01-03-00_50_22_CE7KVWFB/COPY_OUT_PLAN.md` for the actionable, human-executed steps to integrate this delta safely.
