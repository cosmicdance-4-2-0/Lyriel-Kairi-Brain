# NO_TOUCH_BASELINES

The Dreaming and Hearing baselines are normative references. Do not edit their specifications (`docs/specs/DREAMING_BASELINE.md`, `docs/specs/HEARING_BASELINE.md`) or baseline demo files except when explicitly authorized. Any proposed changes must include:

- Explicit approval and change rationale
- Updated conformance tests that capture the new behavior
- Documentation updates describing the new expectations

Baseline demos copied into `web/demos/` are treated as gold masters; changes to them without matching spec and conformance updates are not permitted.
