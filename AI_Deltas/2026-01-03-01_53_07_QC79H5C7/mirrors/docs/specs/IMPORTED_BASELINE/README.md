# IMPORTED_BASELINE (Non-Canonical History)

This directory preserves **historical artifacts** imported from earlier work. These files are kept to retain provenance and show design evolution.

## Status

- **NOT canonical**
- **NOT a conformance target**
- **May be internally inconsistent**
- **May differ from current definitions and terminology**

## What To Use Instead

The authoritative, canonical specifications for this repository live in:

- `docs/specs/`

In particular, refer to:

- `docs/specs/DREAMING_BASELINE.md`
- `docs/specs/HEARING_BASELINE.md`

## Provenance

The contents of this directory were imported from external repositories and are included here for reference and continuity. They are believed to be created by or through the project maintainer and are included with the intent to avoid license conflicts.

If any licensing or attribution issues are discovered, please open an issue so the files can be corrected or removed.
