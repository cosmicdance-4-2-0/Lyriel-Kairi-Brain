# How to Review
1. Open `docs/specs/INPUT_BASELINE.md` inside this delta to read the revised Input baseline.
2. Consult `notes/TERMINOLOGY_MAPPING.md` for Hearing → Input naming changes.
3. See `docs/specs/IMPORTED_BASELINE/README.md` for updated canonical references.

No runtime actions are required; this delta only introduces specification drafts.
