DeltaID: 2026-01-03-00_50_45_7SMXI7WBE
Purpose: State run/readiness guidance for this planning-only delta
Sources:
- None (no runnable assets in this delta)
Notes:
- Use this as a stub; replace with concrete commands once implementation artifacts exist
---

# Run Instructions

This delta does not produce runnable artifacts. When the Dreaming/Hearing implementations are added in future deltas, replace this stub with:

- Commands to launch the web harness (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000` from repo root).
- Any prerequisite install steps for optional tooling or tests.
- Expected outputs or sanity checks for quick validation.

For now, no action is required beyond integrating the planning notes described in `NEXT_STEPS.md`.
