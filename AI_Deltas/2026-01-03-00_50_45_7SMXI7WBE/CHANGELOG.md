# Changelog — 2026-01-03-00_50_45_7SMXI7WBE

## Generated
- Date/Time: 2026-01-03 00:50:45 (local)
- Goal: Provide a minimal, bounded planning packet to guide the first implementation pass of the Dreaming/Hearing baselines without touching canonical sources.

## Files Created
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- `COPY_OUT_PLAN.md`
- `RUN.md`
- `NEXT_STEPS.md`

## Files Mirrored
- None (no repo files were copied into `mirrors/`).

## Known Limitations / TODOs
- No runnable artifacts were produced in this delta; implementation remains to be carried out in repo space outside the delta.
- Copy-out requires manual placement into the repo’s documentation area (see `COPY_OUT_PLAN.md`).
- Future deltas should establish conformance fixtures and seeded runs once core code exists.

## Copy-Out Plan
See `COPY_OUT_PLAN.md` for the explicit, human-executed integration steps.
