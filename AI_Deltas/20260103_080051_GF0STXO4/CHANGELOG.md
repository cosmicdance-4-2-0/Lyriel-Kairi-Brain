# Change Log

- **Timestamp:** 2026-01-03 08:00:51 (local runtime)
- **Goal:** Outline a baseline-preserving plan to move the project from v0.0.1 to v0.0.2, including copy-out instructions and review notes.

## Files Created
- `VERSION_PLAN_v0.0.2.md` — detailed breakdown of tasks for the v0.0.2 release (web harness, tests, docs, versioning).
- `COPY_OUT_PLAN.md` — manual checklist for relocating the planning docs into the live repository.
- `RUN.md` — guidance on how to review the generated documents.

## Files Mirrored
- None. Existing repository files were referenced but not copied or modified.

## Known Limitations / TODOs
- The plan does not implement any code; web harness, fixtures, and version metadata still need to be added in the live repository.
- Integration destinations in `COPY_OUT_PLAN.md` are suggestions; adjust paths to fit repo conventions before copying.

## Copy-Out Plan
- See `AI_Deltas/20260103_080051_GF0STXO4/COPY_OUT_PLAN.md` for the full checklist and rollback instructions.
