DeltaID: 2026-01-03-01_18_09_LHAUG50D
Purpose: Record the documentation-only delta improving next-step readiness guidance without touching core sources.
Sources:
- docs/specs/DREAMING_BASELINE.md
- docs/specs/HEARING_BASELINE.md
- docs/CODEX_Rules/README.md
Notes:
- No repository files outside the delta directory were modified.
- Guidance stays within baseline constraints (no equation or constant changes).

# CHANGELOG — 2026-01-03-01_18_09_LHAUG50D

- **DeltaID:** 2026-01-03-01_18_09_LHAUG50D
- **Generated:** 2026-01-03 01:18:09
- **Goal:** Provide a minimally invasive iteration-readiness packet that highlights immediate wiring tasks for Dreaming/Hearing integration while keeping baseline constraints visible.

## Files Created
- `AI_Deltas/2026-01-03-01_18_09_LHAUG50D/NEXT_STEP_READINESS.md`
- `AI_Deltas/2026-01-03-01_18_09_LHAUG50D/COPY_OUT_PLAN.md`
- `AI_Deltas/2026-01-03-01_18_09_LHAUG50D/RUN.md`

## Files Mirrored
- None (references rely on existing specs and rules).

## Known Limitations / TODOs
- Recommendations require human copy-out into the main docs tree.
- No runnable artifacts are produced; conformance scaffolds remain skipped until core/hearing modules are connected.
- Witness traces and seeded fixtures still need generation once the core is wired.

## Copy-Out Plan
- See `AI_Deltas/2026-01-03-01_18_09_LHAUG50D/COPY_OUT_PLAN.md` for step-by-step human actions and rollback guidance.
